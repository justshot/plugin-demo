1.6.9 (Feb 21, 2019)
===================

Additions
---------

* Added `device.audio.setAudioConstraints()` and `device.audio.unsetAudioConstraints()`. These
  methods allow the setting of a MediaTrackConstraints object to be applied to every time
  `device.audio.setInputDevice()` is called, and any time an active input device is lost and
  the SDK gets new user media to fall back to another input device. If an input device is already set
  via `device.audio.setInputDevice()`, these methods will immediately call `setInputDevice()` internally
  and return the resulting Promise, otherwise they will return a resolved Promise. The currently
  set audio constraints can be seen on the new read-only field, `device.audio.audioConstraints`, which
  defaults to `null`. Example:
  ```
  device.audio.setAudioConstraints({ echoCancellation: true });
  await device.audio.setInputDevice('default');
  // Now we have a live input audio track, opened with echoCancellation:true
  device.audio.setAudioConstraints({
    autoGainControl: false,
    echoCancellation: false,
    noiseSuppression: false,
  }).then(() => {
    // We successfully applied the new constraints and should automatically hear the difference.
    // Future calls to setInputDevice will also use these constraints until they're cleared.
  }, err => {
    // Something went wrong, most likely err is an OverconstrainedError. Let's roll back.
    await device.audio.unsetAudioConstraints();
    // We should now have a working input audio track again
  });
  ```

1.6.8 (Feb 13, 2019)
===================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Applied a workaround to a Chrome regression introduced in M72 affecting `speakerDevices.test()`
  and `ringtoneDevices.test()`: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=930876

Browser Support
---------------

* We are now using RTCP values for RTT where available. Initially, this will not affect Chrome
  because Chrome has [not yet implemented support](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id=9545).
  Additionally, having access to RTT will allow FireFox to calculate and report MOS, however FireFox is
  currently affected by [a regression](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1525341) causing 
  jitter to be reported as 0, which will make MOS scores appear slightly better than they actually 
  are until it's fixed.

1.6.7 (Feb 12, 2019)
===================

Insights
--------

* Now sending ice gathering state change events to Insights as `ice-gathering-state`.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a regression introduced in 1.6.0 causing falsey TwiML params to be stripped.
* `Twilio.Device.audio.disconnect()` will now toggle whether the disconnect sound should play while
  already on an active call.

Additions
---------

* Increased default websocket backoff maximum from 3000ms to 20000ms, and added the `backoffMaxMs`
  option to Device.setup() options that takes a time in milliseconds to override this default. The
  minimum allowable value is 3000ms.

1.6.6 (Feb 5, 2019)
===================

Dependencies
------------

* Updated `ws` dependency to latest. Only affects npm package because the CDN artifact of twilio.js uses
  the browser's WebSocket implementation.

1.6.5 (Dec 3, 2018)
===================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a bug introduced in 1.6.3 preventing metrics from being published.

1.6.4 (Nov 30, 2018)
===================

Additions
---------

* Now sending NetworkInformation stats to Insights.

1.6.3 (Nov 19, 2018)
===================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Stopped sending Insights events that aren't associated with a CallSid or TempCallSid as they can't
  be tracked.

Additions
---------

* Added Device.setup option `{ fakeLocalDTMF: true }` that uses imitation DTMF sounds instead of the default
  real DTMF sounds, preventing an issue where DTMF tones would sometimes register twice.


1.6.2 (Nov 8, 2018)
===================

Additions
---------

* Added `{ sdpSemantics: 'plan-b' }` to the default [RTCConfiguration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCConfiguration)
  object to ensure forward compatibility until unified plan is fully supported in the SDK.
* Added an `rtcConfiguration` field to IDeviceOptions, which takes an [RTCConfiguration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCConfiguration)
  object that gets passed to any created RTCPeerConnections. Example:

```
Device.setup(token, {
  rtcConfiguration: { iceTransportPolicy: 'relay' },
});
```

1.6.1 (Oct 3, 2018)
===================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Re-assigning the master output device mid-call, particularly when calling `device.disconnectAll()`,
  will no longer throw an exception or pause script execution.
* Fixed `closeProtection` feature
* Added EventEmitter interface (`on`, `addListener`, `removeListener`, etc...) to Device singleton.

1.6.0 (Aug 29, 2018)
===================

Additions
---------

* Added the ability to receive and handle incoming calls while on an active call behind a
  new flag, `allowIncomingWhileBusy`. When set to `true`, Device's default behavior of
  silently ignoring the incoming call is removed, and the incoming call will instead cause
  Device to emit an "incoming" event. If accepted, the prior active call will be immediately
  disconnected, and the incoming call will be accepted, replacing the prior active call.

  ```js
  Twilio.Device.setup(token, { allowIncomingWhileBusy: true });
  ```

* Added support for custom incoming parameters from TwiML as `Map<string, string> Connection.customParameters`.
  When a TwiML application sends custom parameters using the `<Parameter>` noun, these parameters will be
  added to `.customParameters`. For example:

  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <Response>
    <Dial>
      <Client>
        <Identity>alice</Identity>
        <Param name="foo" value="bar"/>
        <Param name="baz" value="123"/>
      </Client>
    </Dial>
  </Response>
  ```

  ```js
  device.on('incoming', connection => {
    assert.equal(connection.customParameters.get('foo'), 'bar');
    assert.equal(connection.customParameters.get('baz'), '123');
  });
  ```

1.5.1 (Aug 15, 2018)
====================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Updated Insights logic to point to new endpoint, fully supporting Insights when using Access Tokens

1.5.0 (Aug 8, 2018)
===================

Additions
---------

* `Twilio.Device` may now be instantiated multiple times via

    ```js
    const device = new Twilio.Device(token, options);
    ```

* `Twilio.Device.setup()` may now be called with Access Tokens, in addition to Capability Tokens (CLIENT-4646)
* `Twilio.Device.destroy()` will now completely clear out the Device, allowing `Device.setup()`
   to be called with a new set of options (CLIENT-4951)

Bug Fixes
---------

* We now ensure all Audio resources are cleaned up after closing a Connection (CLIENT-4901)

Deprecations
------------

* The handler functions (cancel, connect, disconnect, error, incoming, offline, ready) have been deprecated
  in favor of using the [EventEmitter interface](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html), which `Device`
  extends. Using the handlers will log a deprecation warning, and as of the next breaking release
  the handlers will be removed. For example, `Device.offline(handler)` should be re-written as
  `Device.on('offline', handler)`. Additionally, listeners can be removed via
  `Device.removeListener('offline', handler)`.

1.4.33 (Jul 5, 2019)
===================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed an issue causing incoming ringtone to continue playing after receiving a Connection error.

1.4.32 (Apr 19, 2018)
===================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed an issue causing region passed to Device.setup to be ignored.

1.4.31 (Apr 16, 2018)
====================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed an issue causing WebSocket requests to sometimes be sent out of order after
  recovering from a lapse in network connectivity.

1.4.30 (Mar 28, 2018)
=====================

Additions
---------

* Fixed an issue where an internal listener wasn't being cleaned up when disconnecting a call,
  resulting in EventEmitter warnings when opening more than 10 calls in a row.
* Added a `Device.isSupported` boolean property, which is `true` if the current browser supports
  all of the features necessary to run twilio-client.js. Example usage:

  ```js
  if (Device.isSupported) {
    Device.setup(token);
  } else {
    // Browser does not support twilio-client.js. Device.setup() will throw if called.
  }
  ```

1.4.29 (Mar 6, 2018)
====================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed an issue that broke Webpack- and likely Browserify-based builds.
