Installation
------------

### NPM

```
npm install twilio-client --save
```

Using this method, you can `require` twilio-client.js like so:

```js
const Device = require('twilio-client').Device;
```

### CDN

Releases of twilio-client.js are hosted on a CDN, and you can include these
directly in your web app using a &lt;script&gt; tag.

```html
<script src="https://media.twiliocdn.com/sdk/js/client/v1.6/twilio.js"></script>
```

Using this method, twilio-client.js will set a browser global:

```js
const Device = Twilio.Device;
```

Testing
-------

Running unit tests requires no setup aside from installation (above). You can run unit tests via:

```
npm run test:unit
```

Integration tests require some set up:

1. If the account you want to use doesn't already have a TwiML app set up, create one using the
   TwiML code below.
2. Copy config.example.yaml to config.yaml, replacing the placeholder information with valid credentials.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Dial>
    <Client>
      <Identity>{{To}}</Identity>
      <Parameter name="duplicate" value="12345" />
      <Parameter name="duplicate" value="123456" />
      <Parameter name="custom + param" value="我不吃蛋" />
      <Parameter name="foobar" value="some + value" />
      <Parameter name="custom1" value="{{Custom1}}" />
      <Parameter name="custom2" value="{{Custom2}}" />
      <Parameter name="custom3" value="{{Custom3}}" />
    </Client>
  </Dial>
</Response>
```

Integration tests can be run via:

```
npm run test:integration
```

These tests will run via karma, one at a time, in your system's default Chrome and then Firefox
